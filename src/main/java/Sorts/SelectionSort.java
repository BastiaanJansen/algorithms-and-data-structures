package Sorts;

/**
 * The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right
 * at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.
 * Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by
 * finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping)
 * it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element
 * to the right.
