/**
 * Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the
 * list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is
 * repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller
 * or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
